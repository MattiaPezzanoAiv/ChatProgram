# ChatProgram
Warning: this is a personal demo and the only purpose is learn how things work.

This is a super simple code (server and client) to manage a chat structure.
The concept is:
-The client can see all the connected users
-The client can create private rooms and invite other users
-The client can message other users privately or the whole room
-The server has a call to get and refresh all the joined clients
